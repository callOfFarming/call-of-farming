            <b>Here are some things you can ask of me:</b><br>
            Say <b>"Stop"</b> and I will stop talking right away.<br>
            Say <b>"what can I plant"</b> to get a list of the seeds you have available.<br>
            Say <b>"current task"</b> and I will tell you what you are currently doing, presumably asking me dumb questions.<br>
            Say <b>"current date"</b> to get the number of days since you've arrived, because you so desperately want to escape.<br>
            There are some additional actions you can do with your plots and plants:<br>
            Say <b>"Harvest plot 1"</b> to harvest plot 1 if it is ready for harvesting.<br>
            Say <b>"Plant potato"</b> and one packet of your potato seeds if you have any will be used on a free plot if you have any.<br>
            Say <b>"Sell 4 potatoes"</b> and I will take 4 potatoes from you if you have enough, and give you buckaroos for the produce.<br>
            Say <b>"Buy 2 potato seeds"</b> and I will take your money if you have enough, and give you 2 packets of potato seeds.<br>
            You can ask about price of things too:
            Say <b>"Look up seed prices"</b> for a list of which seeds are currently available to buy and their respective prices.<br>
            Say <b>"Look up produce prices"</b> for a list of produce currently available to sell and their respective prices.<br>

            Try playing this game with the speaker on, and don't look!
